Here's a potential solution for improving the Add → Export conversion rate:

**Idea 1: Simplify the Export Process**

1. Hypothesis: Reducing the number of steps required to export users will increase conversion rates by making the process more intuitive.

2. Why users drop: Users may be intimidated or confused by the complexity of the current export process, leading them to abandon their efforts and not complete the export.

3. A/B test design:
* Control group: Current export process (5-step process)
* Variation group: Simplified 2-step export process
* Traffic allocation: 50% control, 50% variation

4. Metric to track: Conversion rate from Add to Export (from 43 to the target metric)

5. Expected impact: +15% increase in conversion rate from Add to Export (from 43 to 49.55)

**Idea 2: Highlight Benefits of Exports**

1. Hypothesis: Emphasizing the benefits and value that users can derive from exporting their data will motivate them to complete the export process.

2. Why users drop: Users may not understand or appreciate the value that exports provide, leading them to abandon the process.

3. A/B test design:
* Control group: Current export page with minimal copy
* Variation group: Export page with prominent call-to-action (CTA) and highlighting benefits of exporting (e.g., "Unlock insights" or "Take your data with you")
* Traffic allocation: 50% control, 50% variation

4. Metric to track: Conversion rate from Add to Export (from 43 to the target metric)

5. Expected impact: +12% increase in conversion rate from Add to Export (from 43 to 48.26)

**Idea 3: Provide Incentives for Exports**

1. Hypothesis: Offering incentives or rewards for completing exports will drive conversions by making the process more appealing and rewarding.

2. Why users drop: Users may not see the value in exporting their data, leading them to abandon the process without a compelling reason to complete it.

3. A/B test design:
* Control group: Current export page with no incentives
* Variation group: Export page offering a limited-time discount or free trial for completing an export (e.g., "Get 10% off your next subscription payment")
* Traffic allocation: 50% control, 50% variation

4. Metric to track: Conversion rate from Add to Export (from 43 to the target metric)

5. Expected impact: +18% increase in conversion rate from Add to Export (from 43 to 50.54)

These ideas aim to address the issue of users dropping off during the export process by simplifying the steps, highlighting the benefits, or providing incentives for completing the export.
